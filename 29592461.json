The unit is organized into three parts. The first part introduces students to the field and key concepts of political ecology, conceptualises human-environment relations through society, nature, and capitalism, and introduces some methodological tools for political ecology research. The second part examines applications and variations of this framework, exploring different expressions and cases of human-environment interactions. The third part explores some future directions for political ecology, identifying some philosophical and methodological challenges in conducting, communicating, and reflecting on political ecology research and practice.",

We examine the military ideology of the Assyrians, the internationalism of the Persians, the culture of classical Athens that built the Parthenon, the sweeping conquests of Alexander the Great, the hybrid culture of Kleopatra's Egypt, and the economic-military power of Rome under Caesar and Augustus.

The unit is also designed to prepare students for higher degree studies. The relatively high weighting of this unit reflects the intensity of taking on a major research project in this field. In this unit students may undertake one major project or two separate, though typically closely-related, research projects in an area within behavioural neuroscience. The project(s) will provide training in both discipline specific and generic research skills and form the basis of an honours research thesis presented at the end of the year.",

                "synopsis": "This unit investigates and explores the evolutionary patterns of life on planet Earth throughout 3.8 billion years of 'deep time' geologic history from its simple beginnings to advanced, multicellular life in the fossil record.   How palaeontology developed as a discipline is presented as an overview of the global impacts of the discipline on science and the major players from its earliest origins in Medieval Europe to much later 19th Century researchers in Australia with associated discoveries of megafauna, dinosaurs, early fish, metazoans, and other major finds, that persist with active research to the present day.  Significant milestones in the history of life covered include the early origin of life, metazoan origins in the late Precambrian, Cambrian 'explosion' of organisms with hard parts (both invertebrate and vertebrate), evolution and mass extinctions and their outcomes, biodiversity patterns through time, biologic effects from extraterrestrial impacts, biotic outcomes from volcanism, changing climate and geography (impact of developing aridity on biota, 'Snowball Earth' metazoan origins), the coevolution of plants and animals,  the influences of the plant biosphere with the global environment, and the origin of major animal groups (e.g., molluscs, echinoderms, fish, marsupials). Emphasis on strengths/weaknesses of interpretive methods and how complex science can be presented to a wide audience is also explored. Palaeontology has developed from a more descriptive science of documenting ancient organic remains and their affinities to become also a significant applied field in the quest for global economic resources, such as petroleum (oil and gas), coal and even gold (e.g., graptolite fossils used to date rocks in the Lachlan Fold Belt and associated goldfields of Victoria).  Furthermore, the fossil record has been shown to have remarkable explanatory power for global and regional environmental and ecological changes across a deep time perspective.  As such, lectures and practical's will integrate fossil and many other types of geologic data sets to reinforce how palaeontology endeavours have become 'big picture' science.  A field trip to study richly fossiliferous rocks aims to synthesise knowledge of the fossil record gained from the unit in a practical way to arrive at high level interpretations of ancient biotic communities and their geologic and biologic contexts.",

The students will also acquire foundational knowledge of the care of babies with special needs. Students will have the opportunity to study the circumstances that commonly result in a baby being admitted to a Level Two Nursery. The issues confronting the infant and family during this period will be explored and the role of the midwife in facilitating health and wellbeing of the family. Students will reflect upon and debate the ethico-legal issues involved in care of the baby with special needs. Emphasis is given to the collaborative role of the midwife, consultation and referral, use of medical technology & intervention, and the implications for women, their babies, and midwives themselves.",

Students explore a range of theoretical underpinnings that impact upon the educational process in health care practice with emphasis placed on educational theorists. Students will apply theoretical learning to teaching practice through participation in practicum; or through their role as a teacher within their own clinical practices. This will include both classroom (small and large group) and clinical teaching experiences in a variety of settings. It will equip students with the knowledge and mastery of skills necessary to critique, understand and respond to the learning preferences and needs of those whose education they have responsibility for. It will prepare students with the skills and knowledge to critically evaluate and assess the outcomes of an educational intervention. It will offer students a theoretical underpinning for current modelling of professionalism, clinical competence and lifelong learning.",

We examine issues such as: animal rights, the intrinsic value of nature and eco-centric notions of value. Various ethical dilemmas which arise in relation to our treatment of animals and the environment, the value of wilderness, population growth and the ethical responsibilities that come with globalization will be discussed. These issues are linked to the situation regarding the environment in South Africa and Africa in general, with particular reference to some of the problems encountered within this context.",

It will consider how mystical literature and teaching relates to religious practice, its social/political function within any religion, and the extent to which it may challenge religious authority, while also drawing its discourse from a religious tradition. There will be opportunity to consider mysticism outside as well as within monotheist tradition.

Through studio-based project learning, this unit will introduce its cohort to collaborative activities that encourage thinking beyond traditional discipline specificity, and help students develop hybrid competencies that can be built upon in all ensuing studio units. The projects will blend traditional modes of making with new and innovative ways of doing. Project learning will encourage personal and collective curiosity through applying a range of design enquiry processes such as ideation, prototyping and observation. Students will also learn to be critically reflective, able to review and re-evaluate their design solutions and those of others with clear and constructive communication capabilities.",

This unit will explore in depth the latest techniques for studying gene expression and function, with an emphasis on developing skills in scientific literacy and experimental design using approaches in molecular, cellular, and developmental genetics. This includes assaying and visualizing gene expression and protein subcellular localization in vivo, methods for artificially activating or inhibiting gene activity including generating transgenic organisms and comparative, and bioinformatic methods for inferring gene function and evaluation. The application of these techniques will be demonstrated using examples of the study of the function and evolution of function of genes underlying fundamental cellular, developmental and physiological processes such as differentiation and growth, programmed cell death, cell-cell communication, cell movement, tissue patterning, neuronal signalling, and cellular homeostasis and metabolism.",

The unit explores the principles and analytical methods of political ecology; students will develop an understanding of political ecology frameworks and their diverse applications to real-world cases. The unit is organized into three parts. The first part introduces students to the field and key concepts of political ecology, conceptualises human-environment relations through society, nature, and capitalism, and introduces some methodological tools for political ecology research. The second part examines applications and variations of this framework, exploring different expressions and cases of human-environment interactions. The third part explores some future directions for political ecology, identifying some philosophical and methodological challenges in conducting, communicating, and reflecting on political ecology research and practice.",

Yet leadership is a problematic concept within liberal democracies that have traditionally set out to devolve authority and check against concentrations of power. This unit explores political leadership within liberal democracies using Australia (prime ministers) and the United States (presidents) as its primary empirical reference points. It examines how political leadership has been theorised from classical to contemporary times, including the application of psychology to understand the motivations and classify the behavioural repertoires of leaders. The unit considers how leaders are constrained by context ('the times') and institutional settings. It asks whether leaders make history or are prisoners of it and why certain leaders become associated with transformative change. The unit also explores two of the fundamental functions of political leaders: persuasion and decision-making. It investigates whether it is possible to identify the qualities of successful political leadership. Finally, the unit takes stock of political leadership in the early twenty-first century: an era in which leaders have never seemed more central to politics and yet the challenges of leadership so great. Students will be given the opportunity to choose a leader on which to focus to explore the themes addressed in the unit.",

Students also reflect on how utterances are given meaning (semantics and pragmatics) and the importance of contextual factors in determining whether an utterance is grammatically correct or appropriate.",

The unit will introduce the student to the concept of evidence - based health care practice and how the principles apply to MRI radiography practice. The unit will examine the role played by the radiographer in the operationalization of safety principles within the MRI suite. Clinical indications and the preparation of the patient including the correct positioning methods for the brain, spine, upper abdomen, pelvis, knee and shoulder will be addressed. The purpose of the common sequences used to image the specific organs and structures will be covered and students will learn how to select the most appropriate imaging protocol for the common sequences from within an evidence - based framework. The unit will enable students to recognise the characteristics of the MRI representation of the common pathologies affecting the brain, spine, upper abdomen, pelvis, knee and shoulder. The unit will conclude with an examination of the application of quality assurance and quality control principles to MRI imaging.",

What does it mean in practice to intervene - often across diverse cultural contexts - with programmes designed according to these ideas of development? This unit addresses such questions by deconstructing the conceptual and practical pillars of development, and by interrogating similar concepts such as economic growth, progress, and modernisation. In addition to briefly reviewing some early theorisations of development and their links to colonialism and ideas of modernisation, the unit exposes the power-laden and unequal nature of contemporary development as an institutionalised set of practices that rose to prominence after World War II. Using case studies to paint a picture of geographically uneven development today, the unit explores whether development theories correlate with development-in-practice. It also explores the ways in which diverse social groups and social movements resist Western notions of progress, attempting to reclaim development to forge more autonomous pathways to well-being. These alternative pathways raise questions about the normative side of development, and about whether the contemporary development institution should be deconstructed in practice.",

By visiting the city through literature and film students will be exposed to a diversity of texts, written and visual, that grapple with the complexity of urban spaces and with challenges posed to Italian cities by increased migration. In addition to considering textual representations of urban spaces, a particular focus of the unit will be the urban biography of Prato, from the Middle Ages to the present day. This will include examining how Prato's remarkable economic history has contributed to its distinctive civic identity, and how the culture of the city is reflected in contemporary writings.",

In the late twentieth century key Western European and American thinkers and government advisors claimed that humanity had arrived at the end of history. The combination of the 'liberal' state and capitalism, they claimed, embodies the ultimate form of human organisation. Politics, they argued, is therefore a thing of the past. Many contemporary political theorists challenge this 'post-political' consensus. In doing so they draw on grand theories of politics to develop a range of concepts of 'the political'. This unit aims to examine these different discourses and concepts of 'the political' and to assess their significance for contemporary political questions regarding justice, citizenship and recognition in a globalised, post-Westphalian world. It focuses on the political theories of Carl Schmitt, Hannah Arendt, Jurgen Habermas, Axel Honneth, Chantal Mouffe, Nancy Fraser and Martha Nussbaum.",

The unit examines how archaeologists analyse collections of different kinds of artefacts excavated or collected from archaeological sites, and how histories of the past can be written from these finds. Such objects can include the spectacular, such as status objects and religious icons; and more mundane objects such as ancient food remains, stone artefacts and domestic pottery such as cooking wares. Students will work with real archaeological artefact assemblages and be shown how these can be made sense of as evidence of past cultural practices. They will compare archaeological artefacts with reference materials and systematically apply established methods of analysis developed internationally. These methods, and their implications for understanding the past, will be discussed through case studies drawn from current archaeological projects in the Australia-Pacific region. Students will be expected to attend a weekly 2 hour seminar that includes hands-on discussions of archaeological materials. A film of an archaeological excavation will be shown in one of those seminars, after which students will discuss how artefacts have enabled the archaeologists to work out that site's history.",

Informed by an understanding of the fundamental role of climate stability for sustained population health, and of evidence for anthropogenic global warming, the focus of the unit will be on direct and indirect mechanisms through which climate change could impact on health, including extreme weather events, changing patterns of vector-borne disease, water-borne infections, food quality and availability, air quality, and social disruption. There will be an emphasis on evidence for past and predicted health effects, health burden magnitude and distribution, and the complex interplay between population and environmental factors that influence vulnerability. Students will apply this knowledge to critically appraise adaptation and mitigation initiatives from a public health perspective, and will be expected to engage with current climate change issues and communicate their ideas clearly and effectively.",

Based on these learning points, more focus is given to reading creative writing at this stage, although assignments will revolve around the practise of creative writing. The second objective is to show the interrelatedness between reading and writing. The unit aims to help students understand the importance of close reading in order to fully appreciate good writing by cultivating in them interpretative skills.",

In the pre-modern era, the emotions or 'passions', such as love, desire, fear, and sadness, were seen as mental states that arose involuntarily in the soul as a result of its close connection with the body. They were commonly regarded as corrupting influences on an agent's moral choices and actions. To overcome their influence, philosophers recommended various techniques for either suppressing the passions or turning them into virtues or excellences of character. Following the Augustinian tradition, many regarded love as the key to transforming the passions. This unit explores the moral and metaphysical dimensions of this subject, with reference to both male and female philosophers of the past. Some of the thinkers who may be discussed include St Augustine, Rene Descartes, Elisabeth of Bohemia, Mary Astell, and David Hume. Some of the themes in the unit may be followed into contemporary philosophical discussions.",

By understanding the role of the criminal justice system in histories of Australian colonialism, students will learn how the criminal justice system has attempted to manage Aboriginal people from the European settlement into the present. Considering crime and criminal justice through a settler-colonial lens, students will learn from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voices about experiences of crime and criminal justice, emerging trends in Indigenous justice and consider ways to improve and 'decolonise' current forms of criminal justice. Drawing upon Indigenous perspectives and critical inter-disciplinary work, students will examine topics such as: Indigenous customary law, the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, mandatory sentencing practices, and the policing of public space, language in court systems and Koori courts.",

The fundamental parameters used to describe deterministic traffic flow behaviour are introduced along with a simple traffic flow model. Stochastic traffic flow behaviour is described via random distributions. Fundamental queuing theory of traffic is briefly introduced. The procedures used to analyse the capacity and level of service are explored for both unsignalised and signalised intersections. The principle of traffic signal operation at isolated intersections is presented. Traffic surveys are discussed and students are introduced to contemporary road safety issues as well. Public transport is considered at the route level concerning the determination of fleet size and factors affecting operational capacity and reliability. Non-motorised transport including cyclists and pedestrians is also considered. In addition, the unit addresses Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Consideration will also be given to the role of communications in the practice of transport and traffic engineers. To enhance students' understanding of the unit content from practical points of view, some experts will be invited to give lectures on their relevant work. Throughout the whole unit, the focus is primarily on surface transport systems and applications of advanced technologies therein.",
