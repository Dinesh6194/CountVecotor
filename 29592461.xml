<title>General circulation of the atmosphere</title>
<synopsis>This unit provides an introduction to the large-scale circulation features of the atmosphere and the processes that maintain them.  Students will be introduced to a set of mathematical tools that will be used to analyse the transport of energy, momentum and moisture through the atmosphere and to build a conceptual picture for how these transports are achieved by the atmospheric circulation.  The unit will also touch on how the large-scale atmospheric circulation may respond to climate change, and students will be given the opportunity to engage with the scientific literature on this topic.</synopsis>

<title>Contemporary glass sculpture</title>
<synopsis>This unit introduces students to varied techniques of sculpting with glass.  Working from clay and wax originals glass is cast into hand built refractory moulds, fired in a kiln and then polished.  These processes allow the transference of original and found objects to be re-contextualised into glass.  Students will explore the unique optical and material properties of the medium and will acquire an understanding to contemporary approaches. Projects are conceptually based and can incorporate a multi-media approach.</synopsis>

<title>Medieval dialogues: Reason, mysticism and society</title>
<synopsis>This unit examines the intellectual interaction between Judaism, Christianity and Islam in the medieval period. Focusing mainly on the late twelfth and thirteenth century, the unit revolves around a central religious fault line of the era- reason and rationalism on the one hand, and the mystical quest on the other - and pursues a comparative analysis of the major figures from each of the traditions. Beginning with the rationalists, the course explores the thought of Ibn Rushd, Maimonides and Thomas Aquinas, before moving to a comparative examination of various mystics, such as - Bernard of Clairvaux, Bonaventure, the Zohar, Meister Eckhart, Ibn al-Arabi and Rumi.</synopsis>

<title>Research in political ecology</title>
<synopsis>The unit introduces students to the multi-disciplinary field of political ecology, which considers the relevance of power and politics for shaping the relationship between humans and their environments. The unit explores the principles and analytical methods of political ecology; students will develop an understanding of political ecology frameworks and their diverse applications to real-world cases. The unit is organized into three parts. The first part introduces students to the field and key concepts of political ecology, conceptualises human-environment relations through society, nature, and capitalism, and introduces some methodological tools for political ecology research. The second part examines applications and variations of this framework, exploring different expressions and cases of human-environment interactions. The third part explores some future directions for political ecology, identifying some philosophical and methodological challenges in conducting, communicating, and reflecting on political ecology research and practice.</synopsis>

<synopsis>This unit examines how archaeological and historical evidence can be used to study territorial and cultural expansion in the past. We focus on the development of the first empires in the Mediterranean including Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Athens, Macedonia of Alexander the Great, and Rome as well as the original spread of settlements in Australia and the Pacific. We explore how archaeological remains and historical texts can be used to study the movement of people and ideas and to identify the tactics states use to expand, strengthen, and celebrate their power, including military conquest, colonisation, trade, art, and literature. We examine the military ideology of the Assyrians, the internationalism of the Persians, the culture of classical Athens that built the Parthenon, the sweeping conquests of Alexander the Great, the hybrid culture of Kleopatra's Egypt, and the economic-military power of Rome under Caesar and Augustus. Hands-on tutorials explore the archaeological and historical methods used to reconstruct complex ancient societies.</synopsis>

<synopsis>This unit provides a framework for analysing and evaluating public policy and law in areas of concern in bioethics. The unit focuses initially on what values the state ought to promote, and the formulation of public policy in democratic pluralist societies. These political moralities are then used to examine current law and public policy in areas of bioethical concern, such as abortion, pre-birth testing, embryonic stem cell research, reproductive cloning, surrogate motherhood, voluntary euthanasia, and the treatment of newborn infants with severe disabilities. The unit also considers law and public policy in relation to informed consent, conflict of interest, and the regulation of research on humans.</synopsis>

The studio takes the student through a number of key studio based explorations that underpin and develop an understanding of the inter-relationship between a desired physical outcome and the manner of its production. This includes an appreciation of the core principles of manufacture methods and the impact upon the design of an object due to materiality. Students are encouraged to apply theoretical learning with an experimental approach to problem solving. Project work is presented in folio format, documented for production. Final design proposals are also undertaken in detailed model or prototypical form where appropriate.</synopsis>

<title>Hearing the country: Studies in Indigenous Australian ethnoecology</title>
<synopsis>Australia is the site of a remarkable diversity of systems of knowledge. Indigenous knowledge systems and systems based on western scientific tradition have often been seen as the most distant poles on a continuum that ranges from myth to science. Continuing research in Australia shows that Indigenous ecological knowledge on this continent is detailed, localised and grounded in empirical observations. In addition, Indigenous knowledge is embedded within a system of ethics that is oriented toward long-term productivity. It is usual to contrast Indigenous knowledge with non-Indigenous systems of knowledge and care in order to show their divergence or even, in many instances, their oppositions.</synopsis>

<title>Behavioural neuroscience honours: Research project</title>
<synopsis>The aims of the Honours year in behavioural neuroscience are to increase students understanding of theoretical and methodological aspects of research, develop their analytic, research and communication skills, as well as provide students with advanced knowledge in specific areas of the discipline including laboratory techniques and other research-related skills. The unit is also designed to prepare students for higher degree studies. The relatively high weighting of this unit reflects the intensity of taking on a major research project in this field. In this unit students may undertake one major project or two separate, though typically closely-related, research projects in an area within behavioural neuroscience. The project(s) will provide training in both discipline specific and generic research skills and form the basis of an honours research thesis presented at the end of the year.</synopsis>

<title>War and memory: Resistance, massacre and representation in second world war Italy</title>
<synopsis>Through seminars, workshops and fieldwork this unit will examine how conflict has been represented, remembered and memorialised. The unit will have a specific focus on World War 2, the Italian Resistance, and the massacre of civilians in Tuscany and Emilia Romagna. The unit will consider how written and visual responses to these events, material forms of remembrance - monuments, memorials, museums,  and cemeteries in, or within reach of Prato - each function to memorialise the dead and how in articulating political and national ideologies, such sites acknowledge and incorporate countervailing ideologies and the contradictory testimony of survivors. The unit will unpack, examine and critique the complex inter-relations between media, memory and war, exploring how in pursuit of specific political and cultural goals, memories of conflict are created, constructed and recovered through an array of artistic and memorial forms. Students will be invited to move beyond a purely theoretical understanding of these issues by visiting museums, massacre sites and their memorials, examining and critiquing their mediation and creating a critical/creative response to one such site.</synopsis>

<title>Evolution of life through geological time</title>
<synopsis>This unit investigates and explores the evolutionary patterns of life on planet Earth throughout 3.8 billion years of 'deep time' geologic history from its simple beginnings to advanced, multicellular life in the fossil record.   How palaeontology developed as a discipline is presented as an overview of the global impacts of the discipline on science and the major players from its earliest origins in Medieval Europe to much later 19th Century researchers in Australia with associated discoveries of megafauna, dinosaurs, early fish, metazoans, and other major finds, that persist with active research to the present day.  Significant milestones in the history of life covered include the early origin of life, metazoan origins in the late Precambrian, Cambrian 'explosion' of organisms with hard parts (both invertebrate and vertebrate), evolution and mass extinctions and their outcomes, biodiversity patterns through time, biologic effects from extraterrestrial impacts, biotic outcomes from volcanism, changing climate and geography (impact of developing aridity on biota, 'Snowball Earth' metazoan origins), the coevolution of plants and animals,  the influences of the plant biosphere with the global environment, and the origin of major animal groups (e.g., molluscs, echinoderms, fish, marsupials). Emphasis on strengths/weaknesses of interpretive methods and how complex science can be presented to a wide audience is also explored. Palaeontology has developed from a more descriptive science of documenting ancient organic remains and their affinities to become also a significant applied field in the quest for global economic resources, such as petroleum (oil and gas), coal and even gold (e.g., graptolite fossils used to date rocks in the Lachlan Fold Belt and associated goldfields of Victoria).  Furthermore, the fossil record has been shown to have remarkable explanatory power for global and regional environmental and ecological changes across a deep time perspective.  As such, lectures and practical's will integrate fossil and many other types of geologic data sets to reinforce how palaeontology endeavours have become 'big picture' science.  A field trip to study richly fossiliferous rocks aims to synthesise knowledge of the fossil record gained from the unit in a practical way to arrive at high level interpretations of ancient biotic communities and their geologic and biologic contexts.</synopsis>

<title>Environmentalism: A philosophical perspective</title>
<synopsis>Ethical issues which are raised by the environmental crisis stretch the traditional philosophical concepts, to breaking point. This has led to calls for a completely new ethic based on environmental values and a non-anthropocentric world view.  The unit adopts a global perspective but looks at issues through a South African and African lens. We examine issues such as: animal rights, the intrinsic value of nature and eco-centric notions of value. Various ethical dilemmas which arise in relation to our treatment of animals and the environment, the value of wilderness, population growth and the ethical responsibilities that come with globalization will be discussed. These issues are linked to the situation regarding the environment in South Africa and Africa in general, with particular reference to some of the problems encountered within this context.</synopsis>

<title>Damage tolerance and airworthiness</title>
<synopsis>This unit will explain why aircraft structures/components fail, how engineers can learn from such failure and design to prevent it. Both fundamental and applied aspects of failure of aircraft structural components will be covered. The unit will detail the damage tolerance design philosophy, and how it fits into airworthiness requirements as described in the relevant Standard (JSSG 2006). The unit focuses on how fracture mechanics principles and modern fatigue crack growth laws are used to meet JSSG2006. To illustrate the effect of cracking on service aircraft we will consider flaw growth in a range of aircraft undergoing both in-service flight loading and full scale fatigue tests.</synopsis>

<title>Ecology and biodiversity</title>
<synopsis>This unit is an introduction to ecology; the scientific study of the interactions between organisms and their environment. Ecology and biodiversity forms the foundation for understanding conservation and the management of genetics, species and ecosystem diversity. The approach taken is to address core ecological theory, but with an emphasis on contemporary management issues and applications. Topics include the scope and approaches of ecological enquiry; abiotic and biotic factors determining distributions; population growth and regulation; species interactions; patterns and maintenance of biodiversity; food web analysis; disturbance and succession; and production ecology and nutrient cycling. Particular emphasis is placed on integrating ecological processes across spatial and temporal scales. Practical work will be completed via a field excursion together with in-laboratory practical sessions.</synopsis>

<synopsis>The unit seeks to provide comprehensive coverage of the wide-ranging legal forms, policies and practices in Australia that relate to the upholding of human rights standards. The perspective adopted is new in the sense that human rights laws are not viewed as simply being those laws that expressly refer to rights protection. Rather it is to recognise that in the absence of a strong jurisprudential culture of rights in the Common law world generally, and certainly in Australia, laws protecting as well as infringing human rights nonetheless are apparent.</synopsis>

<title>Organisations and society</title>
<synopsis>The world of work in the 21st century presents exciting opportunities and new challenges for thinking through relationships that exist between organisations and society. At the heart of such debates is how organisations influence and in turn are influenced by the socio-cultural contexts in which they are situated. In this unit we will begin by introducing a framework for conceptualising the organisational/socio-cultural interface and exploring how this impacts those who are situated in and around organisations. We will then focus on specific themes common to contemporary modes of working where organisational dynamics and socio-cultural expectations or beliefs come together. By the end of the unit, students will be able to articulate and apply contemporary theories of organising to a range of ethical, social and cultural challenges that coalesce in and around today's organisations.</synopsis>

It will consider how mystical literature and teaching relates to religious practice, its social/political function within any religion, and the extent to which it may challenge religious authority, while also drawing its discourse from a religious tradition. There will be opportunity to consider mysticism outside as well as within monotheist tradition. It thus raises questions about the nature of mysticism in its various forms, and its relationship to both rational and poetic thought.</synopsis>

<synopsis>The unit will explore modern political governance; the modes of authority, control, and participation within and amongst states. The focus of this unit is on dominant modes of governance, with a particular emphasis on processes of democracy and democratisation. In exploration of this, the unit will explore the development of formal participatory democracy, particularly liberal democracy, as a global norm through the 20th century before examining the pressures for and against democratic development across the world. From a focus on various forms of established liberal democracy (presidential and parliamentary systems), this unit will move to detailed case studies of the Middle East, Latin America, and South-East Asia to investigate efforts at formalising political participation, the persistence of informal modes of participation, and the perseverance of autocratic and authoritarian rule.</synopsis>

<title>Collaborative design studio 1</title>
<synopsis>Collaborative Design Studio 1 will immerse students in the essential, foundational learning required of all fields of design. Students will understand how design thinking informs design outcomes and their impact; have the capacity to identify design problems before navigating solutions; locate the user at the centre of all design challenges; identify and apply design methodologies and processes in ethical and culturally sensitive ways; and understand design is beyond an aesthetic, artefact-centred practice, and one that also embraces embodied, temporal and dematerialised modes of engagement. Through studio-based project learning, this unit will introduce its cohort to collaborative activities that encourage thinking beyond traditional discipline specificity, and help students develop hybrid competencies that can be built upon in all ensuing studio units. The projects will blend traditional modes of making with new and innovative ways of doing. Project learning will encourage personal and collective curiosity through applying a range of design enquiry processes such as ideation, prototyping and observation. Students will also learn to be critically reflective, able to review and re-evaluate their design solutions and those of others with clear and constructive communication capabilities.</synopsis>

<title>Theoretical perspectives of conflict, crime, victimisation and criminal justice</title>
<synopsis>Theoretical perspectives are presented as conceptual frameworks, for instance, causal explanations to identify cause and effect relationships between crime and victimisation phenomena, structural, process and systemic perspectives to emphasise the manner in which the phenomena are interrelated and constitute a whole, system or sub-system, and interpretive approaches to focus on the meaning attributed to particular contexts. Analyses of theoretical perspectives, including a postmodern orientation, refer also the scope and level of a theory to construct different levels of social reality. Finally, the theoretical grounding of research is discussed and evaluated.</synopsis>

<title>Molecular, cellular and developmental genetics</title>
<synopsis>The ability to monitor and manipulate gene activity in experimental models is critical to advance our understanding of how genes control phenotypes. This unit will explore in depth the latest techniques for studying gene expression and function, with an emphasis on developing skills in scientific literacy and experimental design using approaches in molecular, cellular, and developmental genetics. This includes assaying and visualizing gene expression and protein subcellular localization in vivo, methods for artificially activating or inhibiting gene activity including generating transgenic organisms and comparative, and bioinformatic methods for inferring gene function and evaluation. The application of these techniques will be demonstrated using examples of the study of the function and evolution of function of genes underlying fundamental cellular, developmental and physiological processes such as differentiation and growth, programmed cell death, cell-cell communication, cell movement, tissue patterning, neuronal signalling, and cellular homeostasis and metabolism.</synopsis>

<synopsis>The unit explores how media are adopted, adapted and made use of in different cultural contexts. Contemporary anthropologists understand sociocultural groups as strategic users of media technologies that contribute to ever more novel tools for political self-representation. Media are conceptualized in a broad sense, including traditional mainstream media, small and alternative media, as well as social media. The unit provides an overview of the history of and theories in media anthropology and the specific contributions it can make to the broader field of media studies. It covers topics such as politics of representation, news, nation-building, religion, conflict, indigeneity and media activism. In this unit, we deconstruct common notions of active media producers and passive media recipients and analyse how media practices influence social and cultural dynamics (and the other way around) and question or redefine established social convention.</synopsis>

<title>Leaders, power and politics</title>
<synopsis>Leadership is indispensable to politics. Yet leadership is a problematic concept within liberal democracies that have traditionally set out to devolve authority and check against concentrations of power. This unit explores political leadership within liberal democracies using Australia (prime ministers) and the United States (presidents) as its primary empirical reference points. It examines how political leadership has been theorised from classical to contemporary times, including the application of psychology to understand the motivations and classify the behavioural repertoires of leaders. The unit considers how leaders are constrained by context ('the times') and institutional settings. It asks whether leaders make history or are prisoners of it and why certain leaders become associated with transformative change. The unit also explores two of the fundamental functions of political leaders: persuasion and decision-making. It investigates whether it is possible to identify the qualities of successful political leadership. Finally, the unit takes stock of political leadership in the early twenty-first century: an era in which leaders have never seemed more central to politics and yet the challenges of leadership so great. Students will be given the opportunity to choose a leader on which to focus to explore the themes addressed in the unit.</synopsis>

In this unit, students are encouraged to plan one or several acts of curation that need not involve works of art. Students may curate photographs, their hobbies, pieces of art writing, their own objects or those of others. However, the emphasis will be on the final form of the exhibition and the student's ability to explain and justify this curation. These exhibitions can take place in a variety of public spaces, including online. Classes will consist of 3 contact hours in which the lecturer will work with the students, and the students along with the lecturer will hold "crit" sessions in which proposed and upcoming exhibitions are discussed and workshopped.</synopsis>

<title>General linguistics</title>
<synopsis>Language is infinitely creative, yet governed by a set of rules that speakers learn consciously and subconsciously. This unit focuses on making our implicit knowledge about language more explicit. It does this through the two-pronged approach of introducing terminology and notation systems for talking about language structures, and applying this knowledge to real-world language problems. Through a focus on phonetics and phonology (the sounds of speech) and morpho-syntax ('grammar') the unit gives students deeper insight into the workings of English, while also introducing data from a range of other languages for the purposes of comparison. Students also reflect on how utterances are given meaning (semantics and pragmatics) and the importance of contextual factors in determining whether an utterance is grammatically correct or appropriate.</synopsis>

<title>Crime and inequality</title>
<synopsis>In this unit students explore the contemporary and historical significance of 'difference' in structuring patterns of law making, offending, victimisation, criminal justice system responses and experiences. Students are introduced to theoretical paradigms and empirical approaches for identifying and understanding marginalisation and inequality in society. Students are taught how to identify and draw connections between broader societal experiences of inequality and marginalisation and the development and orientation of systems of law and criminal justice. The unit focuses on factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, (dis)ability, regional inequalities, income and wealth distribution, social class, and homelessness, and examines how current patterns of social and economic inequality contribute to the disproportionate victimisation and criminalisation of certain marginalised populations in society.</synopsis>

<title>Modern political thought</title>
<synopsis>Modern political theorists grapple with significant political and social transformations such as capitalism, bureaucratisation, rationalisation and globalization. They diagnose various 'pathologies' they fear might result from these transformations: alienation and injustice, disenchantment and authoritarianism, nihilism and social disintegration. They also identify political solutions to these maladies: revolutionary action, charismatic leadership, new forms of democracy and citizenship, or new types of social movements. This unit examines and assesses modern political theorists' diagnoses of and cures for modern society, focusing on how they conceptualise key political concepts such freedom, power, community and legitimacy. It will do so by examining the political theories of Marx, Durkheim, Weber, Foucault, Habermas and other contemporary critical theorists.</synopsis>

<synopsis>This unit aims to develop skills to describe and analyse health systems and assess health sector reforms (or health system reforms) in both developed and developing countries, including Australia. The unit introduces participants to alternative conceptual frameworks for describing and analysing health systems, and focuses in particular on one - "the control knobs framework" - which describes the key levers of a health system and how these levers work to influence outcomes of interest such as equity, cost, financial risk protection and quality of care. The control knobs framework is used to describe and analyse health system outcomes in developed and developing countries (including Australia); diagnose existing policy reform challenges; shed light on ongoing health policy debates; and assess a recent case of reform in the health sector.</synopsis>

<title>Deconstructing development</title>
<synopsis>What does 'development' mean as a body of ideas that structures systems of power, flows of resources, and social transformations across the globe? What does it mean in practice to intervene - often across diverse cultural contexts - with programmes designed according to these ideas of development? This unit addresses such questions by deconstructing the conceptual and practical pillars of development, and by interrogating similar concepts such as economic growth, progress, and modernisation. In addition to briefly reviewing some early theorisations of development and their links to colonialism and ideas of modernisation, the unit exposes the power-laden and unequal nature of contemporary development as an institutionalised set of practices that rose to prominence after World War II. Using case studies to paint a picture of geographically uneven development today, the unit explores whether development theories correlate with development-in-practice. It also explores the ways in which diverse social groups and social movements resist Western notions of progress, attempting to reclaim development to forge more autonomous pathways to well-being. These alternative pathways raise questions about the normative side of development, and about whether the contemporary development institution should be deconstructed in practice.</synopsis>

<title>The age of the Samurai</title>
<synopsis>The unit explores the history of Japan and East Asia via an examination of the figure of the samurai. The focus is broadly on the period from 1185 to 1867 when Japan was ruled by a succession of warrior regimes but the unit will also explore the evolution of samurai images and representations primarily in film but also in books, anime, manga, and video games. The central concern is with the evolution of the figure of the samurai across this long period and with the constant tensions between the ideals put forward about the way of the warrior and the actual realities of samurai life.  We will explore the samurai from varied perspectives by considering questions of status, identity, politics, gender, and economics.</synopsis>

<title>The Italian city: Historical and literary perspectives</title>
<synopsis>The Italian city, a microcosm of Italian society, reveals the rich layers of Italian culture and history. This unit explores Italian cityscapes through their monuments and art works and their representation in literature and film. It offers a journey through the social spaces of the modern city to the virtual zones of the postmodern city. By visiting the city through literature and film students will be exposed to a diversity of texts, written and visual, that grapple with the complexity of urban spaces and with challenges posed to Italian cities by increased migration. In addition to considering textual representations of urban spaces, a particular focus of the unit will be the urban biography of Prato, from the Middle Ages to the present day. This will include examining how Prato's remarkable economic history has contributed to its distinctive civic identity, and how the culture of the city is reflected in contemporary writings.</synopsis>

<synopsis>Evolution has shaped and continues to shape humans and the world in which we live. Some of the most challenging issues facing society such as the battle of the sexes, war and violence, population growth and even the global obesity epidemic can be understood through the process of evolution. An evolutionary perspective also equips us to address emerging issues such as the manipulation of human behaviour, spread of infectious diseases, the rise of allergies, the ethics of cloning, food security, and the biodiversity crisis. This unit will highlight how an appreciation of evolution can transform our understanding of the human condition, modern society, and the profound global challenges that we are currently facing - enabling us to develop robust and creative solutions for the future.</synopsis>

This unit examines this phenomenon from the uprisings of peasants in medieval Europe to the protests of students in the 1960s, focusing in particular on what has famously been called 'the weapons of the weak'. We will trace both changes and continuities across time by paying special attention to the causes of rebellion, resistance and revolt, the motives of subordinate individuals and groups, the ways they defined and legitimised their struggle, and the tools they have adopted to wage their battle against authority.</synopsis>

<title>Advanced studies in design</title>
<synopsis>This unit is the capstone studio for those students who have, with permission, undertaken a customised suite of design units from across collaborative design, Interaction design and/or Multimedia Design. Having been exposed to an array of discipline studios over 3 semesters, this unit allows students to develop a high level conceptual approach to design problem solving relevant to their preceding studio experiences. Drawing from the design processes and methodologies developed in previous studios they are able to discover, define, design, develop and realise a unique, individualised and sophisticated design outcome. Students engage deeply with their chosen project and are able to further develop and advance their efficacy in design.</synopsis>

<title>Grand theories of politics and international relations</title>
<synopsis>This unit investigates the concept of 'the political' in modern and contemporary political theory. In the late twentieth century key Western European and American thinkers and government advisors claimed that humanity had arrived at the end of history. The combination of the 'liberal' state and capitalism, they claimed, embodies the ultimate form of human organisation. Politics, they argued, is therefore a thing of the past. Many contemporary political theorists challenge this 'post-political' consensus. In doing so they draw on grand theories of politics to develop a range of concepts of 'the political'. This unit aims to examine these different discourses and concepts of 'the political' and to assess their significance for contemporary political questions regarding justice, citizenship and recognition in a globalised, post-Westphalian world. It focuses on the political theories of Carl Schmitt, Hannah Arendt, Jurgen Habermas, Axel Honneth, Chantal Mouffe, Nancy Fraser and Martha Nussbaum.</synopsis>

<title>Artefacts, objects and remains: Making sense of archaeological sites</title>
<synopsis>Archaeologists understand archaeological sites by the artefacts they contain. The unit examines how archaeologists analyse collections of different kinds of artefacts excavated or collected from archaeological sites, and how histories of the past can be written from these finds. Such objects can include the spectacular, such as status objects and religious icons; and more mundane objects such as ancient food remains, stone artefacts and domestic pottery such as cooking wares. Students will work with real archaeological artefact assemblages and be shown how these can be made sense of as evidence of past cultural practices. They will compare archaeological artefacts with reference materials and systematically apply established methods of analysis developed internationally. These methods, and their implications for understanding the past, will be discussed through case studies drawn from current archaeological projects in the Australia-Pacific region. Students will be expected to attend a weekly 2 hour seminar that includes hands-on discussions of archaeological materials. A film of an archaeological excavation will be shown in one of those seminars, after which students will discuss how artefacts have enabled the archaeologists to work out that site's history.</synopsis>

Key critical criminological, feminist, masculinities and queer theories are used to explore how social norms of femininity and masculinity produce particular sexed understandings of crime and criminality. Theoretical insights and contemporary understandings of the criminal justice system, popular and media representations, and development of public policy responding to sex and crime are surveyed, and critical assessments made. Topics include sex and the nature of crime; gender and policing; femininity, masculinity and violence; and, sexed and sexual violence.</synopsis>

<title>Media anthropology: Power, culture and representation</title>
<synopsis>The unit explores how media are adopted, adapted and made use of in different cultural contexts. Contemporary anthropologists understand sociocultural groups as strategic users of media technologies that contribute to ever more novel tools for political self-representation. Media are conceptualized in a broad sense, including traditional mainstream media, small and alternative media, as well as social media. The unit provides an overview of the history of and theories in media anthropology and the specific contributions it can make to the broader field of media studies. It covers topics such as politics of representation, news, nation-building, religion, conflict, indigeneity and media activism. In this unit, we deconstruct common notions of active media producers and passive media recipients and analyse how media practices influence social and cultural dynamics (and the other way around) and question or redefine established social convention.</synopsis>

In this unit emphasis is placed on independent investigation, and the development of the creative and expressive potential inherent in students' work. Imagination combined with advanced conceptualisation and innovation in material manipulation should be manifest at this stage of students' practice. Whilst providing a stimulating and supportive environment this unit provides a bridge between students' experience in the supervised studio and a fully-fledged independent professional practice in the broader arts arena.</synopsis>

<title>History of philosophy: Emotions</title>
<synopsis>The unit will examine issues to do with emotions in the history of philosophy. In the pre-modern era, the emotions or 'passions', such as love, desire, fear, and sadness, were seen as mental states that arose involuntarily in the soul as a result of its close connection with the body. They were commonly regarded as corrupting influences on an agent's moral choices and actions. To overcome their influence, philosophers recommended various techniques for either suppressing the passions or turning them into virtues or excellences of character. Following the Augustinian tradition, many regarded love as the key to transforming the passions. This unit explores the moral and metaphysical dimensions of this subject, with reference to both male and female philosophers of the past. Some of the thinkers who may be discussed include St Augustine, Rene Descartes, Elisabeth of Bohemia, Mary Astell, and David Hume. Some of the themes in the unit may be followed into contemporary philosophical discussions.</synopsis>

<title>Indigenous justice in Australia</title>
<synopsis>The unit introduces students to issues of Indigenous justice and injustice in Australia. This unit focuses on critically understanding the relationship between colonialism in Australia, Indigenous Law and systems of justice and contemporary concerns of injustice. By understanding the role of the criminal justice system in histories of Australian colonialism, students will learn how the criminal justice system has attempted to manage Aboriginal people from the European settlement into the present. Considering crime and criminal justice through a settler-colonial lens, students will learn from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voices about experiences of crime and criminal justice, emerging trends in Indigenous justice and consider ways to improve and 'decolonise' current forms of criminal justice. Drawing upon Indigenous perspectives and critical inter-disciplinary work, students will examine topics such as: Indigenous customary law, the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, mandatory sentencing practices, and the policing of public space, language in court systems and Koori courts.</synopsis>

<title>Finance and society</title>
<synopsis>This unit is intended to contextualise students' acquired knowledge for solving problems in real world domestic and global situations. As a capstone unit, it should be studied in the final semester of the finance major as it draws upon and integrates learning from previous units studied. The unit encourages students to recognise that finance is a powerful tool for solving our common problems, and increasing the general wellbeing, but may give rise to ethical dilemmas. Students will be exposed to choices and conflicts requiring judgement and thus appreciate that finance can play an important role in helping society achieve its goals.</synopsis>

<title>Transport and traffic engineering</title>
<synopsis>This unit introduces students to the field of transport and traffic engineering. The fundamental parameters used to describe deterministic traffic flow behaviour are introduced along with a simple traffic flow model. Stochastic traffic flow behaviour is described via random distributions. Fundamental queuing theory of traffic is briefly introduced. The procedures used to analyse the capacity and level of service are explored for both unsignalised and signalised intersections. The principle of traffic signal operation at isolated intersections is presented. Traffic surveys are discussed and students are introduced to contemporary road safety issues as well. Public transport is considered at the route level concerning the determination of fleet size and factors affecting operational capacity and reliability. Non-motorised transport including cyclists and pedestrians is also considered. In addition, the unit addresses Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Consideration will also be given to the role of communications in the practice of transport and traffic engineers. To enhance students' understanding of the unit content from practical points of view, some experts will be invited to give lectures on their relevant work. Throughout the whole unit, the focus is primarily on surface transport systems and applications of advanced technologies therein.</synopsis>

<title>English as an international language: Writing across cultures</title>
<synopsis>With English being an international language, using only one pattern of writing in English as the 'best' model because English speaking countries are the 'exclusive sole owners' of the language may no longer be relevant. What is considered to be "good or bad writing" in English, therefore, deserves thorough and critical investigation. This unit encourages students to investigate a variety of English writing practices in intercultural communication contexts.
